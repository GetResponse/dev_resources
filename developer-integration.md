### Developer integration

If you have some idea to integrate GetResponse with some other service, feel free to do so in any way you want.
Our only rule is that your code should be well written, with principles of good design in mind. 

You can use any language you want, but we prefer some more than others:

* PHP
* Perl
* Ruby
* Python
* Objective C
* Java

are the best one :)
